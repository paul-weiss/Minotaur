# Run the private attack
Change the binary_path variable in `run_minotaur_private_attack.sh` and `run_ouroboros_bitcoin_private_attack.sh`. Then run the shell script to launch attacks and get logs. Use the ipython notebook `process_results.ipynb` to process the results. Notice that the bitcoin setting is the same as ouroboros setting in terms of a private attack.

# Results of experiments in the paper
Minotaur and Ouroboros results are in `paper_results.zip`. Unzip it, and use `process_paper_results.ipynb` to process the results.
